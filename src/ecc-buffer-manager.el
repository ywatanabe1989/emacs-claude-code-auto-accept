;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This module provides a modern, robust buffer management system for
;; Claude AI interactions.  It supports multiple concurrent Claude sessions,
;; buffer lifecycle management, and persistent buffer metadata.
;;
;; The buffer manager keeps track of Claude buffers using a registry with
;; strong and weak references, ensuring that buffer operations are safe
;; even when buffers are killed.
