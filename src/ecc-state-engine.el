;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This module provides a clean, modern state engine for managing Claude AI
;; interactions.  It uses a proper state machine model for reliable state
;; transitions and detection.
;;
;; The state engine provides hooks for state transitions, making it easy to
;; trigger actions when the AI's state changes.
